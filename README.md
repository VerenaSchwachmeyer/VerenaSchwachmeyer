## Short intro about me

My "coding experience" started back in 2011 when I worked on my phD thesis. I taught myself to write scripts in MATLAB in order to handle large datasets, synchronize and analyze them. My skills improved over time and I realized how much I enjoy coding. However, creating nice and handy UIs was still missing in my skillset - web development filled this gap and now I enjoy "crafting" different kind of full stack web apps. 

I have been working primarily with ReactJS but reached a point where I couldn't ignore its limitations such as limited SEO or client-side rendering, leading among others to large first contentful paints (FCP). 
This is why I moved on to NextJS. Currently, I am creating a NextJS app using the new app router and learning TypeScript. PHP and Shopware are next in my pipeline.
