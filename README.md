# Hi, I am Verena ðŸ‘‹

Hey, thanks for visiting me here on my GitHub profile. If you haven't seen my portfolio website yet, you might want to check it out for more info about me: https://www.schwachmeyer.dev

## Short intro about me

My coding experience started back in 2011 when I worked on my phD thesis. I taught myself to write scripts in MATLAB in order to handle large datasets, synchronize and analyze them. My skills improved over time and I realized how much I enjoy coding. However, creating nice and handy UIs was still missing in my skillset - web development filled this gap and now I enjoy "crafting" different kind of full stack web apps. 

I have been working primarily with ReactJS but reached a point where I couldn't ignore its limitations such as limited SEO due to pure client-side rendering, leading among others to large first contentful paints (FCP). 
This is why I moved on to NextJS. In the meantime, I have written several apps and created websites using NextJS. My portfolio website is actually not up to date anymore - I currently just don't have the time for updates. Ask me if you would like to see examples of my work.
